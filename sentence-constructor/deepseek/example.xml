    * BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    * BAD: The beginning sentence is uncessary, should just start showing vocabulary table
    * BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because students needs to figure that out
    * BAD: The sentence structure says too much   we really want something that is conceptual like this

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you get started.
        
        Vocabulary Table
        
        | Japanese	|Romaji	| English |
        |-----------|-------|---------|
        |           |kuma	| bear |
        |           |tobira	| door |
        |           |gomi	| garbage |
        |           |usunda	| left out |
        |           |mita	| looked/seen |
        
        Sentence Structure
        
        To create the sentence, you'll need to think about the following structure:
        Bears (kuma) + location (at the door)
        Past tense question (did you leave)
        Garbage (gomi) + action (leave out)
        
        Clues
        Here are some additional clues to help you:
        To say "at the door," you'll need to use a location indicator.
        The verb "left out" will need to be in the past tense.
        To ask a question, you'll need to use a specific question marker.
        
        Your Turn
        Now it's your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary and structure above. Don't worry if you make mistakes – that's all part of the learning process!

        Cheatsheet: 

        | Word | Japanese | Type | 
        |------|----------|------| 
        | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun | 
        | door | ドア | Noun | 
        | garbage | ゴミ | Noun | 
        | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb | 
        | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

        Sentence structure:
         [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
            - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
            - The first part is stating a location where something exists
            - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
            - attempt an answer
            - ask clues about location marking
            - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
            - ask clues about question formation
            - ask clues about verb conjugation
