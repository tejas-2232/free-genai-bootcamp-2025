## Initial Response

```
Okay, let's tackle this. The student wants to translate "Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden." into Japanese. First, I need to break down the sentence into parts.

Start with the vocabulary. The main words are "see" (miru), "raven" (karasu), "this morning" (kesa), "garden" (niwa), and "our" (watashitachi no). I should present these in a table without particles, so the student figures out the particles themselves.

Next, sentence structure. The first question is "Did you see...?" which in Japanese often uses the past tense of miru, which is mimashita. The structure here might be [Time] [Object] [Verb]? For the second sentence, "They were looking at..." which is a continuous action. Since the student is JLPT5, maybe use the te-iru form, so mite imashita. The structure could be [Subject] [Location] [Verb].

Clues and considerations: The student needs to remember to use the past tense for "see" and the past continuous for "looking." Also, "they" might be implied by context, so using karasu-tachi or just leaving it out. The possessive "our" would be watashitachi no niwa. Particles like o for the object in the first sentence and ni for direction in the second.

Possible mistakes: Forgetting to conjugate miru to mimashita, incorrect particle usage (o vs. ga), and forming the continuous tense correctly. Also, ordering of time phrases—kesa should come at the beginning.

When the student attempts, check if they used the correct verb forms and particles. If they make an error, give hints about tense or particles without giving away the answer. Encourage them to refer to the vocabulary table and structure examples.

Vocabulary Table

| Japanese	| Romaji    | English |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
|見る       | miru	    |   to see|
|カラス	    | karasu	|raven|
|今朝	    |kesa	    |this morning|
|庭	        | niwa      |garden |
|私たちの	 |watashitachi |no	our|

Sentence Structure

First Sentence: [Time] [Object] [Verb (past tense)]?
Example: Did you see the raven this morning? → [今朝] [カラス] [見る]?

Second Sentence: [Subject (implied "they")] [Location] [Verb (continuous past tense)].
Example: They were looking at our garden. → [私たちの庭] [見る].

Clues & Considerations

Use the past tense for "see" (見ました mimashita).

"They" can be omitted in Japanese if contextually clear.

"Looking at" requires the continuous form (見ていました mite imashita).

"Our garden" uses the possessive 私たちの庭.

Next Steps:

Try constructing the first sentence using the structure above.

Remember particles like を (object marker) and に (direction marker).
