## Student Input:
Bears at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


## Examples:

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it it.

<example>

    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    <user:input>

    <score> 4 </score>
    <score_reason> 
    * BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank
    * BAD: The beginning sentence is uncessary, should just start showing vocabulary table
    * BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because students needs to figure that out
    * BAD: The sentence structure says too much   we really want something that is conceptual like this
    </score_reason>

    <assistant:output>
        
        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you get started.
        
        Vocabulary Table
        
        | Japanese	|Romaji	| English |
        |-----------|-------|---------|
        |           |kuma	| bear |
        |           |tobira	| door |
        |           |gomi	| garbage |
        |           |usunda	| left out |
        |           |mita	| looked/seen |
        
        Sentence Structure
        
        To create the sentence, you'll need to think about the following structure:
        Bears (kuma) + location (at the door)
        Past tense question (did you leave)
        Garbage (gomi) + action (leave out)
        
        Clues
        Here are some additional clues to help you:
        To say "at the door," you'll need to use a location indicator.
        The verb "left out" will need to be in the past tense.
        To ask a question, you'll need to use a specific question marker.
        
        Your Turn
        Now it's your turn! Try to put the sentence together using the vocabulary and structure above. Don't worry if you make mistakes – that's all part of the learning process!

## Good Example:

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    <user:input>

    <score> 10 </score>
    <score_reason> 
    * GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
    * GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre 
    * GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations    
    </score_reason>

        Cheatsheet: 

        | Word | Japanese | Type | 
        |------|----------|------| 
        | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun | 
        | door | ドア | Noun | 
        | garbage | ゴミ | Noun | 
        | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb | 
        | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

        Sentence structure:
         [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
            - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
            - The first part is stating a location where something exists
            - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
            - attempt an answer
            - ask clues about location marking
            - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
            - ask clues about question formation
            - ask clues about verb conjugation
    </assistant:output>

</example>


Student Input: Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.

## The example Meta Ai provided:

Vocabulary Table:

| Japanese | Romaji	| English|
|----------|--------|--------|
| 鴉（からす）	|karasu	 |raven
| 朝（あさ）	|asa	 |morning
| 庭（にわ）	|niwa	 |garden
| 見た（みた）	|mita	 |saw/seen
| 見ている（みている）	| miteiru	| looking
| 私たちの（わたしたちの）|watashitachi no	| our

Sentence Structure:
[Time] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Verb-present] [Object]

Considerations:
This sentence has two parts: a question about seeing something in the past, and a statement about what was happening in the present.
You'll need to think about how to indicate time, subject, and object in each part of the sentence.
You'll also need to consider how to connect the two parts of the sentence.
