## Student Input:
Bears at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


## Examples:

Here are examples of user input and assistant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it it.

<example>

<user:input>
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
<user:input>

<score> 4 </score>
<score_reason>
* BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank
* BAD: The beginning sentence is uncessary, should just start showing vocabulary table
* BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because students needs to figure that out
* BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this
</score_reason>

<assistant:output>

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and create a vocabulary table to help you get started.

Vocabulary Table

| Japanese |Romaji | English |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| |kuma | bear |
| |tobira | door |
| |gomi | garbage |
| |usunda | left out |
| |mita | looked/seen |

Sentence Structure

To create the sentence, you'll need to think about the following structure:
Bears (kuma) + location (at the door)
Past tense question (did you leave)
Garbage (gomi) + action (leave out)

Clues
Here are some additional clues to help you:
To say "at the door," you'll need to use a location indicator.
The verb "left out" will need to be in the past tense.
To ask a question, you'll need to use a specific question marker.

Your Turn

## Good Example:

<example>
<user:input>
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
<user:input>

<score> 10 </score>
<score_reason>
* GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
* GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
* GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
</score_reason>

Cheatsheet:

| Word | Japanese | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
| door | ドア | Noun |
| garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
| to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
| to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

Sentence structure:
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Considerations:
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
- The first part is stating a location where something exists
- The second part is asking about a past action

Possible next steps:
- attempt an answer
- ask clues about location marking
- ask clues about how to connect two sentences
- ask clues about question formation
- ask clues about verb conjugation
